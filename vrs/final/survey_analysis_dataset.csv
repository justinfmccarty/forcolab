At some point it is easier and more cost effective to replace the home entirely, which seems more likely with the land prices in Vancouver, particularly if this home on a large lot is replaced with a duplex or other more dense housing.","Achieving Step 3 or greater would require improved air tightness and most importantly, central ventilation through an HRV. Adding HRV ducting to an existing home seems unlikely to me. In addition, the home would require major updates to the building envelope thermal performance as well as air tightness. I don't believe these are likely to happen due to the cost"

Under existing/anticipated policy within this timeframe, gas heating is still allowed, and fossil gas has artificially low rates due to subsidization of the industry.
